# Replicathon 2019 (IQ BIO REU, UPR-PR)

Clone or download this repository to your computer and open the `.Rmd` files in [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/).

## Main Analysis Template

* [`analysis_template.Rmd`](analysis_template.Rmd) : R markdown template which each team will use to create a fully reproducible analysis with the goal of assessing and interpreting the replicability of two pharmacogenomic experiments. This document will contain all of the text and code of their analyses, which are quided by a series of questions. The tools and concepts needed to answer the questions are explored in the tutorials.

## Datasets

* `rawPharmacoData.rds` : raw data file generated by `downloadData.R` that contains drug response data at every dose and for each cell line and drug used in both studies. 

* `summarizedPharmacoData.rds` : summarized data file generated by `downloadData.R` that contains drug response data (combined over all doses) for each cell line and drug used in both studies.

## Tutorials

Each tutorial contains text and code that explores various aspects of data science, replicability, and reproducibility. Tutorials `0a` provides a gentle introduction to R for those with limited programming experience. Tutorials `1a` to `2b` contain questions to fill in, some require written answers and some require code to produce a plot or numerical summary.

* [`0a_R_basics.Rmd`](tutorials/0_R_basics.Rmd) : "Introduction to R Basics"

* [`0b_R_tidyverse.Rmd`](tutorials/0b_R_tidyverse.Rmd) : "Introduction to the Tidyverse"

* [`1a_explore_rawData.Rmd`](tutorials/1a_explore_rawData.Rmd) : "Exploring pharmacogenomic data with the `rawPharmacData` dataset"

* [`1b_explore_summarizedData.Rmd`](tutorials/1b_explore_summarizedData.Rmd) : "Exploring replicability with the `summarizedPharmacoData` dataset"

* [`2a_deeper_subgroups.Rmd`](tutorials/2a_deeper_subgroups.Rmd) : "Digging deeper with cell line and drug subgroups"

* [`2b_deeper_summarization.Rmd`](tutorials/2b_deeper_summarization.Rmd) : "Digging deeper with  drug response data summarization"

## Code to generate data files (You do not need to use this)

For full reproducibility, this is the script to generate the `RDS` files. This step has already been done for you, and the data files should be available as part of this repository without running the script.

* [`downloadData.R`](downloadData.R) : a script that uses the [PharmacoGx](http://bioconductor.org/packages/PharmacoGx/
) package to format two datasets (raw and summary level) and save them as `RDS` files.
